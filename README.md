A browser text editor using ace.js that lets you save files, and then lets you see those files. 
Those files delete every 5 minutes, that can be easily modified.

There is an emoji face to the right of a file that when clicked, will open up that file.
All created files are placed inside the same directory, so they can be linked.
For example, a created .html file can have <script src="yuss.js"></script>
If yuss.js is a created file, then the .html file will load the .js file
